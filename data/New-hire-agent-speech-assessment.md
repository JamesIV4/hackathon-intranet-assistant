# Literature survey on filled pause detection

* * *

  *   *   *   *   *   * 


# Plan of action

* * *

  * **areas of focus:**
    * **pronunciation features:**  such as a phone's spectral match to native speaker acoustic models and a phone's duration compared to native speaker models;
    * **fluency features:**  such as the rate of speech, mean pause length, and number of disfluencies;
    * **prosody features:**  such as pitch and intensity contour; and
    * **reading accuracy features:**  such as the percentage of words incorrectly read. 
  * responsibilities:
    * Linda: design a pool of sentences (statements and questions) to use to collect data. These should be carefully selected to cover the four feature areas listed above.
    * Jason: design simple web app for collecting audio
    * Veera, Aravind: modeling, analysis
