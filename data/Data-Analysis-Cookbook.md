# Priorities For Development

  1. Internal Tools fundamental to the analysis (for SDA only)
  2. 'External' Tools that make it easier to visualize/interpret the data (e.g. look at IG/OOG/CA/etc)

# Preparing Data for Analysis

  * Data Stored on i3filesarchive
  * Process ISR Call Logs with summarize_diagnostics (i3asr\test_apps\summarize_diagnostics)** **  

    * Segment audio
    * Create i3asr_sim xml file
    * **NB: app may need some refinement**
  * Transcriptions complete & available on i3filesarchive (via SDEs or LionBridge)



# Running i3Speech Apps

#### i3asr\test_apps\i3asr_sim:

Application to run ASR simulations, performing multiple tasks on diagnostic recordings.

  * Convert XML log file into human readable CSV
  * Run simulation experiments on diagnostic recordings (using meta-data in XML logs)
  * If transcriptions are provided, check IG/OOG for a recognition
  * downside: no way to turn off VAD, even though input audio is already segmented (so VAD essentially runs twice)
  * sample xml available below (page bottom)



#### i3asr\test_apps\test_wave_files:

Performs automatic speech recognition on specified audio files and grammar.

  * For more lower-level debugging or investigation
  * provides actual hypothesis



#### i3sisr\test_apps\sentence_evaluator:

Evaluates whether a string is IG or OOG, and then determines the semantic meaning of in-grammar sentences by evaluating the SISR tags.

#### Process

  * Run audio using vadless app (test_wave_files) and post-process results from simulator (i3asr_sim) to create a single result. 
  * **Need a 3rd app to merge results from test_wav_files into i3asr_sim to get final result**. Ananth & Ram will coordinate on what is required here.  




# Standard Analysis Toolkit

Python module to post process the simulator results and extract meaningful information. Includes some basic analysis tools that leverage the module.  Will add to this list.

  1. Generate overall results
  2. Plot confidence ROC curves
  3. Get utterances based on confidence, grammar or transcription
  4. vad tool: e.g. if hit speech really early in segmented data, could be problem utterance b/c initial VAD failed

  5. snr tool: help identify bad expected performance for very quiet or very noisy recordings




****Ram has a draft of #1-3 already (\\\speechanalytics\Public\RamSundaram\SDATools)****

****These should be checked in at \src\i3asr\speechscience****

****Goal is to keep working on 'general infrastructure tools' (like #1-3), and in parallel work on developing more signal-processing tools (like #4 & 5).  
****

# Result Reporting

  * Template for SDA Reports
  * Have a portal like SpeechTuner for visual analysis



# Miscellaneous Other Tasks/Initiatives

  * Collecting Customer Data from PureCloud (working with Nicholas Luthy on this)
  * Collecting Customer Data in PCI-compliant manner from SEG clients

# Sample XML file for i3asr_sim input

i3asr_sim accepts a xml format file as input. This xml file is generated by processing the log file that has many other details.
    
    
    <?xml version="1.0" ?>  
    <Simulation>  
     <Properties>  
     <Param name="confidencelevel" value="0.0"/>  
     </Properties>  
     <Session audio="E:/speechData/DeltaDental/wav/20160303/100151260840160303/ASRLOG_1001512608_172348-utt001.wav" id="0" language="en-US">  
     <Recognition>  
     <Grammar id="null" type="application/srgs+xml"><http://ai101268d:8080/DeltaDental/grammars/neutral/NULL_VOICE.grxml></Grammar>  
     <Grammar id="dd04025" type="application/srgs+xml"><http://ai101268d:8080/DeltaDental/grammars/en-US/DD04025_ByFax_DM.jsp></Grammar>  
     <Grammar id="globalcommands" type="application/srgs+xml"><http://ai101268d:8080/DeltaDental/grammars/en-US/GlobalCommands_noprevious.jsp></Grammar>  
     <Transcription>yes</Transcription>  
     </Recognition>  
     </Session>
    
    
    </Simulation>

Each session is associated with audio, grammars and reference transcription. Some overall recognition parameters can be set in Properties section

Multiple Session files can use provided and they are independent
