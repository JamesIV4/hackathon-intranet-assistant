MRCPv2 employs a session establishment and management protocol such as SIP in conjunction with SDP. The client finds and reaches an MRCPv2 server using conventional INVITE and other SIP transactions for establishing, maintaining, and terminating SIP dialogs. The SDP offer/answer exchange model over SIP is used to establish a resource control channel for each resource. The SDP offer/answer exchange is also used to establish media sessions between the server and the source or sink of audio.
