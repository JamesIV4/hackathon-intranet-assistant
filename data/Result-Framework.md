## Notes

  * **21 Sep 2011:** I moved the aborted/suspended changes from last winter to a team branch -- [//depot/team/core/main/ResultFramework](http://perforce.inin.com:8081/@md=d&cd=//depot/team/core/main/&c=74c@//depot/team/core/main/ResultFramework/?ac=83). In retrospect the mixed-case team name was probably a mistake, but I don't think there's any way to change it without mucking up perforce even more. Sorry 'bout that.  \--
