# MRCP Support in Recognition Subsystem

## Abstract

This presentation provides an overview of how MRCP support was added to the Recognition Subsystem. I provide some background information about MRCP and how the Recognition Subsystem currently works. The presentation then explains the pros and cons of using MRCP and why we will need to support it. An overview of how MRCP support fits into the Recognition Subsystem is then discussed. Finally, I discuss some of the challenges that I ran into during this project.
