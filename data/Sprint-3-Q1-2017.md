Team member| Task| Priority| Completion| Remarks  
---|---|---|---|---  
Rajesh| Use Log Bap feature for noise level adjustment in both voiced/unvoiced regions

  * Verify in Time and frequency domain Matlab codes

| 5| 60%| Bap feature helped only for Voiced regions.  
 | Address issues related to en-US, de-DE, en-AU| 5| 50%| en-AU work is in progress. Identified Jayde is more suitable than Kandyce templates.  
 | Model local variance using Keras| 3| 100%| Local variances are extracted.  
Pavan| Evaluate i3asr results using alphanumeric model and checked-in model on alphanumeric data| 5| 100%|    
 | Evaluate i3asr results using ININ and alphanumeric data model for en-US| 5| 100%|    
 | Start training using added de-DE data| 4| 100%|    
 | Train de-DE digit model with 'uh' separate for null| 4|  |    
 | Documentation of the work| 5| 100%|    
Naresh| Presentation for the group| 5| 100%|    
 | Verify i3asr accuracy for Global, male and female zh-CN models| 5| 0%| Models are ready. Need to verify in i3asr  
 | Complete STP training using smaller networks for en-US, en-AU, pt-BR and de-DE| 4| 100%|    
 | Evaluate Pavan's procedure on nl-NL| 5| 100%|    
Tejas| Analyze frame error analysis| 5| 0%|    
 | Train en-AU larger model and apply compression on the larger model| 4| 0%|    
 | Evaluate Pavan's procedure on en-AU| 5| 100%|    
Veera| Generate static, delta, delta-delta features for local variance| 4| 100%|    
 | Play with different architectures and parameters using Merlin DNN training| 4| 50%| Tried on English using 1024*4 network.  
 | Finalize best lean models for en-US, en-AU and de-DE| 5|  |    
 | Verify Pavan's procedure on zh-CN| 4| 100%| Completed and verified results with Kaldi. Need to test with i3asr
