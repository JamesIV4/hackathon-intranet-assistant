## Abstract

Which is better, Human Annotation or Machine Annotation?  The CIKM conference had a section on crowdsourcing annotations, but at ININ more deal more broadly with questions of when it's most appropriate for using automated annotations and what the appropriate role is for expert annotations.  This talk provides an overview of the strengths and drawbacks of each method, as well as some heuristics & best practices for choosing which is best for a given project.
