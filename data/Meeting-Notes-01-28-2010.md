  * Discussed state management of resources when doing a join: 
    * There is nothing in the SDP that indicates whether the SDP is for an offer or answer.
    * We need to create an attribute for a join to indicate if the join is an offer/answer.


  * Discussed items brought up during SIP support meeting: 
    * New feature request from SIP Support is to be able to view the current status of a media server: 
      * Trusted or not
      * Logged into notifier
      * Registered via SIP
    * Current media server status will be written in DS (values TBD)
    * SIP support was also wondering in which log the i3sip/taprvoider/tasip traces were going to go.
