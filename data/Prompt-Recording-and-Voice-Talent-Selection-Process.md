**Notes**

  1. Jayde | Spanish U.S. | GM Voices | Oct 2013. Effort led by Scott Randal. Full re-record needed for training of our own TTS.  Not in Clay. High quality recording. 
  2. We will use the same prompt recordings for Spanish South America in 2015R1 as the ones used to train our own TTS, per the note above.
  3. ** AS of March 2015, we cannot use this company again, (as they are no longer our BP and are only willing to help us at last resort for very expensive price tag).**

  4. For FR-FR, TTS team decided to use Hilorie with a European accent. Because Hilorie is also the voice talent for FR-CA, the TTS team is most likely going to refer to her as Manon. Decision made in April 2016

## Prompt Specifications with Project Team Related Roles / Responsibilities

  * Prepare and generate IVR-specific prompt recording list
    *  _(Design Architect)_


  * Prepare and generate "system" prompt recording list
    *  _(Design Architect, Application Development Engineer)_
    * (These are generic prompts such as numbers, dates, months, days of week and so on, that will be used in a variety of applications and throughout the application system. These prompts are often already recorded and available, depending on the voice talent selected, so "scrubbing" this list beforehand can save time and expense during recording sessions, by avoiding needless duplication or recorded prompts.)


  * Record application prompts, providing professional direction, voice coaching, and sound engineering.
    * _(Recording Engineer, Design Architect)_
    * _Prompts are typically recorded with the following parameters:_
      * Normalized to -16rms
      * WAV, RAW, and/or µ-law file formats
        * 8 kHz, 8-bit µ-law  with WAV extension -OR--
        * 16 kHz, 16-bit PCM with WAV extension -OR--
        * 48 kHZ, 16-bit PCM with WAV extension
          * (All 3 of these formats are typically delivered)
          * Buffer is typically recorded in WAV format, then converted to customer specs during editing
      * No more than a 20-ms lead-in and trailing silence for each prompt recording
      * All prompts should recorded at 20db



### Windows Explorer Bit Rate vs. Actual Sampling Rate / Bit Rate

 _Note: GM Voices folders used as an example for this information_

64 kbps == 8 khz | 8 bit (Ulaw)  
256 kbps == 16 khz | 16 bit  
705 kbps == 48 khz | 16 bit

**Other Formats**

 _Note: This combination was seen but appears to be due to post-processing manipulation where an audio file with a 16 khz sampling rate was downsampled to 8 khz but saved as 16 bit PCM. These files work but are not ideal._ **  
**

128 kbps == 8 khz | 16 bit

## Prompt Wav File Naming Convention

<Project Code><Dialog Number>_<Dialog Name>_<Pitch>_<Type>_<Index Number>.wav 

**Example:**  RT1000_GenericGreeting_I_01.wav 

### **Section Definitions**

  * #### Project Code

    * A two to four letter code representing the project or customer, i.e. RITA -> RT, Pure Cloud Voicemail -> PC, Pearson Education -> PRS.
  * #### Dialog Number

    * A unique number associated to each dialog, i.e. 1000_Main, 1000 would be the Dialog Number.
  * #### Dialog Name

    * A unique name associated to each dialog, i.e. 1000_Main, Main would be the Dialog Name.
  * #### Pitch (If Applicable)

    * downward
      * Denotes a drop in pitch at the end of the word or phrase.
      * May also be referred to as 'Falling' but the term 'downward' is the SSDG standard.
    * medial
      * Denotes an even tone often used for concatenating two prompts together.
      * May also be referred to as 'Neutral' but the term 'medial' is the SSDG standard.
    * upward
      * Denotes an increase in pitch at the end of the word or phrase.
      * May also be referred to as 'Rising' but the term 'upward' is the SSDG standard.
  * #### Type


Abbr.| Description| Comments  
---|---|---  
**C  **| Confirmation|   
  
**E**|  Exit|   
  
**I**|  Initial| May result in a Retry depending upon business requirements  
**NI**|  No Input| May result in a Retry depending upon business requirements  
**NM**|  No Match or if used for both NI & NM| May result in a Retry depending upon business requirements  
  
  * #### Index Number

    * An integer indicating a specific prompt. It is often the case that several prompts may be necessary depending upon the business case. An example of this would be multiple No Match (NM) prompts that provide additional clarification upon each no match event.



### gmvoicesrequirementsFull Spectrum - Prompt Naming and Editing Conventions

This section exists to capture the differences in naming required by the Dev Language Research Group. The audio files that fall into this category are used by this team to model / create the text to speech synthesis engine.

  * **Project**
    * <Vendor>_<locale code>_<voice talent name>
      * **Example:  **GMV_fr-CA_Hilorie
  * **Deliverable**
    * **ZIP**
      * <Vendor>_<locale code>_<voice talent name>_<domain>_<prompt ID range>.zip
        * **Example:  **GMV_fr-CA_Hilorie_ivr_1-500.zip
    * **Prompt Naming**
      * <Vendor>_<locale code>_<voice talent name>_<domain>_<prompt ID>.wav
        * **Example:  **GMV_fr-CA_Hilorie_ivr_1.wav
      * **Prompt Naming of Alternates**
        * When an alternate is introduced, it needs to be named consistently with the original prompt naming.
          * <prompt name>_ALT.wav
  * sessionsetupdetails **Session Setup Details**    
(GM Voices Specific) - Ideally this would be followed by everyone.
    * Direction via bridge line and Skype (For instructions specific to directing TTS recordings, see )

    * The SAME Engineer will be assigned to every session.
    * All technical specs will be set up exactly the same each session, i.e, microphone placement etc. 
    * Playback of some prompts from the previous session at the beginning of each session, to ensure voice talent consistency.
    * After recording begins for each session, GMV to send ININ a segment (5-10 minutes) of audio for quick evaluation.  The session will then continue once ININ has verified everything is acceptable.
      * Mike to work with Engineer and client to establish this process.
      * If Voice Talent misspeaks, she needs to restart the prompt from the beginning (not pick up in the middle)
      * The Engineer will carefully notate if any verbiage is changed during the sessions, and we will provide this information in a complied list at the end of the project.



## Original Prompt Order Archival

In this section the process by which the original prompt orders from ANY vendor will be defined. The goal here is to reduce the time necessary to retrieve the original prompts in case post processing was performed after their delivery. These files are not to be modified once checked in. The process is as follows.

  1. Copy the zip file that contains the prompt order into //speechsolutions/main_systest/pub/resources/global_prompts/Orders/_< vendor name>_
     1. If the vendor doesn't already have a directory under the orders directory, create one, GMVoices is the vendor that currently exists and its directory is named as such.
     2. No spaces should be used in the directory name.
  2. Check out / Create the OrderDetails.csv
  3. Update the document by adding a new row with the order number and its description.
  4. Submit the changelist and enter a description along these lines, "Checking in the original prompts from _< vendor>_ order _< order number> <description>."_
