# The `i3inet` module

## Abstract

The ION `i3inet` module provides the underlying framework for several of our higher-level protocol stacks based around [RFC822-style](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5322) messages -- specifically the `i3http`, `i3sip` and `i3mrcp` modules. This presentation was aimed primarily at developers of those modules, and any future similar projects.
