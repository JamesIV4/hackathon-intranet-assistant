## Description

* * *

The purpose of this ISM is to provide a Company Directory object that can be incorporated either within the Menu building suite, Task Editor, or both. This effort will require several teams to collaborate on the design and implementation of the Interaction Speech Moduleâ„¢.

## Project Team Breakdown

* * *

### Speech Solutions Development Group :

  *     * Project Lead - Jeff Wiebe
    * Lead Engineer - Yoel Newman



#### Mission :

Design and create the Architect version of the Credit Card Payment module, using the application design that was generated during the ABC Financial project.

### Architect UI Development :

  *     * Manager / Architect - Jim Ullyot
    * Engineers
      * Scott Bauer
      * Mitch Mounts
      * Scott Brookie 



#### Mission and Purpose for Inclusion :

The Architect team should be utilized as a consultant group with respect to the following;

  *     * Assist with Architect Development Environment that Yoel will need to use for his work.
    * Guidance on what is required to create, implement, and test this module within Architect
    * Outline process for release / deployment to PureCloud in its entirety once available for sale.



### Architect Services Development :

  *     * Colin Frazier



#### Mission and Purpose for Inclusion :

The User Interface and Architect code creates merely the necessary Domain Specific Language (DSL) that the Edge Voice XML generator creates. This means that this group needs to be included in the design discussions to ensure that what is being created / requested can be consumed or outlining the changes necessary for consumption on their end.

## Project Plan

* * *

  * Design
    * User Interface for Architect
      * What should it look like?
      * What configuration options are needed and what defaults are expected?
        * A list of ALL the parameters need to be defined and then separated into what a user has access to and what 
      * Follow Industry Design User Interface Standards currently in use by Architect
        * Please push the envelope to ensure that quality UX is thought of for future ISM's as well as any additional modules with respect to Speech in the future. We will be setting the bar for our other modules with this release.
        * **Will this go in the menu structure as well as the Task Editor?**
    * Implementation
      * Outline what is necessary to create, test, and implement this ISM for general use.
  * Development / Test / QA / UAT
