This page outlines the manner in which the Speech Solutions Development Group utilizes Sprints within Speech Projects. The Speech Application Methodology is broken up into 4 phases, Pre-Discovery, Discovery, Design, and Development. It is has been implemented into 5 phases where Development is broken up into two sub-phases, Development and Development-QA. Each of the implementation phases exist within a JIRA Speech Project as an Epic. These Epics will also be used as Sprints. The following information is a breakdown of each implementation phase and how a Sprint might be broken up.

## Speech Application Phases as Sprints

### Pre-Discovery

The Pre-Discovery phase currently contains the Features for the Request for Product / Quote or RF[P/Q], Statement of Work or SOW, and a Contact Center Assessment or CCA. These three items will need time estimates associated with how long it would take to complete the effort. This could break down as follows; RF[P/Q] - 16 hours, SOQ - 1 hours, and CCA - 2 hours. This brings the total time to 2 days and 3 hours.

When the RR[P/Q] is received and work is begun the first step should be . After all of the items from that page have been completed and time estimates entered on the Issues within the Pre-Discovery phase a Sprint can be started.

  1. Click Start Sprint
  2. Change the name to Pre-Discovery 1.0
     1. The 1.0 signifies the GA release and also allows for later epics for possible later versions to be created with the name of Pre-Discovery X.X.
  3. Drag in the RF[P/Q], SOW, and CCA Issues.
  4. Click Start Sprint
     1. The start time should use the timestamp for the email that contains the RF[P/Q] request / information.
     2. The end time will not be changed until the customer signs the SOW.
        1. By following this paradigm a report can be created that shows the time it takes for a customer to send an RFP to the time they sign.
