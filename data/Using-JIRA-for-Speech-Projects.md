## Description

* * *

The Speech Solutions Development Group, SSDG as it will be referred to going forward in this document, uses JIRA for its Project Scheduling and Issue Tracking. This is done by using a Portfolio Level Project, [Speech Projects](http://devjira.inin.com/browse/SP), which is a custom JIRA project created specifically for SSDG. Details of this configuration can be found on this page . SSDG also has a JIRA project titled [Speech Solutions](http://devjira.inin.com/browse/SSDG) which is used for any documents, templates, and tools that may be used in customer projects. Lastly, each customer will have its own JIRA project/projects using the following JIRA Project as its template, [Speech Project Template](http://devjira.inin.com/browse/SPTEMPLATE). This template was designed following the Speech Project Methodology which can be found on the main SSDG page under the Library section. The following will outline what steps are necessary to use JIRA for any and all SSDG Project needs.

More information regarding Agile Planning and Tracking can be found on the Agile Coaching Confluence page.
