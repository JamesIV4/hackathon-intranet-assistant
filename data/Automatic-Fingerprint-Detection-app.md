The  is currently the best overview for the methodology (note that the future work stated on slides 8 and 9 as well as the ending Future Work slide - item 1- were initially implemented right after the hackathon)

Example test runs

  * 2019-08-01 test
    * Input diagnostics
      * \\\i3filesarchive\SpeechAnalyticsData\CallAnalysis\Chile\CaseCC-495_Telefonica\automated_fingerprint_detection\small_sample_test_set\diagnostics
    * Base output file directory  

      * \\\i3filesarchive\SpeechAnalyticsData\CallAnalysis\Chile\CaseCC-495_Telefonica\automated_fingerprint_detection\small_sample_test_set\example_output_from_the_automatic_fingerprint_detection_app
    * Automatically generated fingerprints
      * \\\i3filesarchive\SpeechAnalyticsData\CallAnalysis\Chile\CaseCC-495_Telefonica\automated_fingerprint_detection\small_sample_test_set\example_output_from_the_automatic_fingerprint_detection_app\\_class_finder\Analyze\autogenerated_fingerprints
        * 'simple_classification_transcription_match' folder
          * These fingerprint wav files were named based on finding a corresponding transcription match in the existing (global) fingerprint database (transcription matched, so use the same classification)
        * 'simple_classification_translation_match' folder
          * These fingerprint wav files were named based on finding a corresponding translation match in the existing (global) fingerprint database (transcription matched, so use the same classification)
      * Note that no validation  has been done to ensure these are good fingerprints (human reviewed for classification and translation name, regression testing to ensure no false positives, and testing to ensure these match all of the original diagnostics that they were created to fix)
