## Importing LogViewer Filters

 _**VoiceXMLServer specific set used as an example**_

  1. Open any ininlog file  

     1. Required to have access to the filter configuration dialog
  2. Open the Filter Configuration Dialog
     1. Filter -> Filter Configuration or Clicking the Filter Configuration icon on the toolbar.
  3. Review your existing filters for duplicate versions of the filter names below.
     1. If duplicate names exist a message box will appear asking if you'd like those replaced. I'd say yes but it's up to you.
  4. At this point you can decide if you wish to delete all of your existing filters or merge.
     1. To delete all your filters right click on the filter list and choose Delete All Filters from the pop-up menu.
  5. Import the new filters
     1. Select File -> Import Filters
     2. Browse to the directory selected in step 1 to select the new filter set and click Ok.
        1.      3. Select File -> Save Filters
        1. If this step is not performed the filters will not be saved and you'll have to re-import them.
  6. The filters have now been successfully added / updated and you can now close the Log Viewer Utility.
