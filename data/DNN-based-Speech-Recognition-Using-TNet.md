Presenter - Roger Ge

Abstract

This presentation summarizes our current work in LVCSR under CD-HMM-DNN framework using TNet. It first introduces the basics of DNN, such as what neural networks are, what neural networks in machine learning can do, types of neurons and networks, cost function, forward and backward propagation algorithm; Then, it goes through the setup of DNN-based speech recognition setup, including data preparation, parameter settings, model initialization, DNN training and decoding, scoring, HMM-GMM training, decoding and realignment, layer-wise pretraining. After providing the result of current experiment, the presentation also highlight the decoding module of TNet in details, which contains feature transform and forward propagation. Finally, it provides a list of references that one can find more useful and related information.
