  * Media server API has to return the location of where a media context is created in the result of the command.
  * Should we represent 2833 events as a separate link from audio? 
    * We will use attributes to control 2833 events on pins.
    * We won't automatically do inband synthesis and analysis just based on the join-invite. We rather fail joins that don't have 2833 that doesn't have a pin.
